 Prediction of protein-coding /protein-non coding regions in DNA sequences using machine learning by representation of the DNA sequence in chaos game representation (CGR) 
# Abstract
Abstract
 Detection of the protein-coding sequence in mammalian species genomes finds wide applications in areas like biodiversity research, evolutionary studies,  and understanding the genomics features.  Here, we proposed a novel method to detect the coding sequence and non-coding sequence using chaos game representation (CGR) and different supervised machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes algorithm, Logistic Regression algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm, Perceptron algorithm and support vector machine (SVM)) for classification. In order to gain high accuracy, the input feature vector to each algorithm should reflect the true nature of the genomic sequence. The representation of the DNA sequence in CGR is able to give both graphical and numerical representations of the genomic sequences. Using CGR, a DNA sequence can be mapped to a numerical sequence which truly represents the original data.  Here, we collected coding sequence and non-coding sequence (intron) of four mammalian specific genes (LCE6A, IL2, CSN1S1 and SMCP) as training dataset and for testing dataset two mammalian tumour related genes (TP53 and STK11) which have high mutation and substitution rate, from ten mammalian species. GCR image obtained from those six genes then the feature vector extracted as input for the five algorithms. Results with the SVM achieved the highest accuracy, hence we recommend it for the classification between coding and non-coding CGR images for the future mammalian related CGR genomic studies.
